This task has one main.cpp file

The input file should be test.off (precisely the output for the second task). The output will be test_fixed.off.

If you have CLion, I recommend to run this file in Release mode. Copy test.off to cmake-build-release folder and run the project. In the same cmake-build-release folder you will find test_fixed.off.
